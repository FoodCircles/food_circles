## Welcome to the FoodCircles app

#### BOFO

Buy One, Feed One. 

#### Can we leverage our dining intentions to feed the hungry?

FoodCircles curates great, local restaurants and lets you buy a dish for $1 or more. 100% of your purchase gives 1 (or more) children the food they need to survive.

#### Together, we can provide food to those in need.

The food we provide to children are always nutrient-filled,
life-sustaining meals, organic when possible.  If you choose Grand
Rapids as your area of impact, we work with an agency called Kids Food
Basket to provide a turkey/ham sandwich (or pb&j), a fruit, a serving of
veggies, two snacks and a drink for every $1 spent.

#### Where we are now.

Today, FoodCircles helps diners in Grand Rapids, Michigan thrive.  We help them find good food, save money, and help children in need.  You pay-what-you-want for drinks, desserts, and
appetizers, we give 100% to get food to children who need it.  $1 given,
1 child fed.  Thank you for joining us.
