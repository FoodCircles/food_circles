#### BOFO

Buy One, Feed One. 

#### Can we leverage our dining intentions to feed the hungry?

At first, we focused on ourselves as the hungry; driving extra boneless
wings, chips & salsa, discounts, etc. in Ann Arbor, MI.  But we learned
that true impact is created by solving needs, not wants.  We wanted
extra food with our meals, but many others needed food, period!  But
when introduced to Buy One, Feed One, restaurants were so enthused by
the idea that they let us keep the deals, serving them as "thank you's"
to participants.  Wow!

#### Together, we can provide food to those in need.

The food we provide to children are always nutrient-filled,
life-sustaining meals, organic when possible.  If you choose Grand
Rapids as your area of impact, we work with an agency called Kids Food
Basket to provide a turkey/ham sandwich (or pb&j), a fruit, a serving of
veggies, two snacks and a drink for every $1 spent.  Check out reviews
of this meal from people who tried it! (here, here, and HERE)

#### Where we are now.

Today, FoodCircles helps folks in Grand Rapids, MI feel good about their
dining.  We help them decide where to eat, save money, and help get food
to the poor.  You pay-what-you-want for drinks, desserts, and
appetizers, we give 100% to get food to children who need it.  $1 given,
1 child fed.  Thank you for joining us.
