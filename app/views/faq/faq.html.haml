      .question
        %h3 How do I feed a child in need by eating out?
        %p Easy.  Whenever you're planning a meal out, grab a voucher from our website or app, which covers an item at your chosen restaurant.  100% of that purchase is donated to get food to children who need it, at your area of choice.
      .question
        %h3 Ok. Bought a voucher. Now what?
        %p Simply visit the restaurant within 30 days with your receipt displayed or printed (you can get it via email, text message, or on your app). Show the 5-digit code to your server and then hit Mark As Used to redeem.  
      .question
        %h3 Are there any rules/requirements to redeem?  I don't like surprises.
        %p Each guest should purchase regular food or drinks when redeeming a voucher. All "Buy One, Feed One" restaurants are locally-owned and made the decision to give 100% of your voucher purchase to feed others.  Let's support 'em as much as we can.

    .question
      %h3 What?  Why are some places out of stock?  
      %p Restaurants only give us a limited amount of "Buy One, Feed One" vouchers per week.  So if you see one, grab one!  We'll add vouchers every <b>Saturday</b>. If you miss the one you wanted, join the waitlist and you'll have first dibs when the next ones arrive.
    .question
      %h3 Can I use this in a group?
      %p Yup, you can even buy dish "upgrades" if you dine in a group of four or more (see item for details).  You may only redeem one voucher per every two guests, and dish "upgrades" require four or six guests each.
    .question
      %h3 Can I buy a voucher for someone else?
      %p Glad you asked!  Simply buy the voucher for yourself, and <strong>reply to the confirmation email</strong> with whomever you want to receive it.  We'll pass on the good news. <br><br> Want to double down on doing good?  Simply mention it to your server and they will send your $1 dish to a customer behind you, to the table of your choice (cute girl across the restaurant?), etcetera.
    .question
      %h3 How do I see past vouchers I've bought or how many kids I've fed so far?
      %p Access previously purchased vouchers on <a href="http://www.joinfoodcircles.org/timeline"> your Timeline</a>.  And there will definitely be little things you'll do to cause us to ask your mailing address and send you something special.
    .question
      %h3 What happens to my donation if my voucher expires?
      %p Don't worry.  While you will not be able to redeem the voucher at a restaurant, the money you paid still ends up feeding hungry children.  So someone gets fed, even if it's not you.
    .question
      %h3 So, how are kids fed exactly?
      %p When you're making a purchase, you choose either a local or food-crisis destination for your meals. Each $1 you spend gets dinner to a child locally or an entire day's worth of food to a child in West Africa.  All distributing organizations are registered as 501 (c) 3, and are reviewed on Charity Navigator.
    .question
      %h3 How do I know the funds are going to be used to feed kids?  Are my purchases tax-deductible?
      %p We follow up with you sometime after your purchase with a confirmation that the specific number of kids will be fed in your selected area, along with an organizational contact.  Purchases are not currently tax-deductible.
    .question
      %h3 Do you share my information to the charity that distributes the meals?
      %p No.  We require follow-up reports from the charities involved and pass their gratitude on to you, but we will not share your contact information with them.
    .question
      %h3 If you guys donate 100%, how do you pay bills?
      %p Since we send traffic to local restaurants, they pay us a monthly program cost which covers the roof over our heads.  The restaurant also gets to meet passionate, impact-driven people, like you!
    .question
      %h3 Is this just throwing food at a problem or is there an actual solution to ending hunger?
      %p We absolutely believe in ending the immediate suffering of children who aren't able to play or learn because they are hungry.  The consequences can be permanent.  We believe the ultimate solution to hunger lies with parent education, but until that can be resolved, we will help the children who are suffering as a result.
    .question
      %h3 The charity I wanted to send my funds to isn't here!
      %p Have them check out <a href="http://www.joinfoodcircles.org/nonprofits">'For Nonprofits'</a>.
    .question
      %h3 Where's the jobs page?
      %p Want to work with us?  Come find us (we're around!) or contact us on <a href="http://www.joinfoodcircles.org/about_we">About We</a>.
