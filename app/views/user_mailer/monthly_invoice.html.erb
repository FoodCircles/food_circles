"#bofo" comes alive to guests when you make it real they're doing something 
special by eating at your restaurant. These guests aren't coming in based on a deal, but based on the 
fact that you share a belief with them – that <b>no one</b> should go to bed hungry. The little things 
you can do (table tents, conversation, etc) matter.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>We'd love to hear how the movement is taking hold in your restaurant. Our promise is this: anything we can do to help you, your staff, or to promote the fact you <b>are</b> a "Buy One, Feed One" 
establishment, we will. Call us 24/7 at (616) 61-FOOD-6 or email us at support@joinfoodcircles.org.</i></p>
