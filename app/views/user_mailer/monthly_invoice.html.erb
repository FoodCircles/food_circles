    Hi there
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <%= link_to "Click here", invoice_url(vid: @calculations.venue.id, months_before: 1) %>
    to get a detailed invoice
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Summary: <%= @calculations.human_readable_summary %>
    You met <%= @calculations.payments.count %> tables of customers who dined at your restaurant to feed those in need.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
"Buy One, Feed One" comes alive to your customers when you make it real that they are doing something 
special by eating at your restaurant. These customers aren't coming in based on a deal, but based on the 
fact that you share a belief with them â€“ that no one should go to bed hungry. Accordingly, the little things 
you can do (placards, "thank you's", etc) matter, and drive returns. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">We'd also love to hear your input on how the movement is taking hold in your restaurant. Our promise is 
this; anything we can do to help you, your staff, or to promote the fact you are a "Buy One, Feed One" 
restaurant, we will. Call us 24/7 at (616) 61-FOOD-6 or email us at support@foodcircles.net. </p>
