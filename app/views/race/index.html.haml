          %h2 FAQ
          %ul
            %li
              %h3 How do I participate?
              %p Simply use our app or website to eat at a FoodCircles Restaurant.
            %li
              %h3 Which restaurants?
              %p Any of the FoodCircles Restaurants.  We're buying one meal at each one.  It's up to you to be first one to claim it.
            %li
              %h3 What if I want to go to a different restaurant?
              %p Ask staff you know at any restaurants to join the Buy One, Feed One movement.  If they end up doing so, let us know you got the ball rolling, call a couple friends together, and let us buy you a meal there.
            %li
              %h3 Where are donated meals going?
              %p
                We buy meals for people in need either through our local partner,
                = succeed "," do
                  %a{:href => "http://kidsfoodbasket.org"} Kids Food Basket
                or our partner based in Kenya,
                %a{:href => "http://worldvision.org"} World Vision
            %li
              %h3 What if I go over the spending limit?
              %p Great! It's good to support local-owned business.  We can only afford to reimburse up to our stated limit, but splurging just got a whole lot cheaper.
            %li
              %h3 What if my party is more than 6 people?
              %p Great way to help local-owned restaurants.  We can only reimburse the per-diner spend for 5 of your friends though (so choose wisely).
            %li
              %h3 Does this include alcohol / tips / etc?
              %p We just need to see the bottom line of receipt, friend.  Make sure you follow individual restaurant rules too!
            %li
              %h3 Do I need to tell the restaurant anything special?
              %p Nope.  Use our call-ahead if you want, and just show staff the ticket on your phone like you'd normally do when using our app.  Purchase your meal as regular, and enjoy a special free dish for being there under the Buy One, Feed One flag.
            %li
              %h3 When does the Great Race end?
              %p When our "Claims List" has been exhausted, we will conclude the race.
            %li
              %h3 Can I use the app after The Great Race is over?
              %p We hope you see the opportunity cost of not using it when you eat out!  You really can put food on someone's plate through this app, and get special treatment in the process.
            %li
              %h3 How many times can I claim a Great Race Restaurant?
              %p Once per legal name/email address/Facebook or Twitter account.
            %li
              %h3 I'm having trouble with the FoodCircles app/site - what do I do?
              %p
                Give us a call at 312 945 8627, or email <a href"mailto:support@foodcircles.net">support@foodcircles.net
                \.
            %li
              %h3 Why are some unclaimed restaurants unavailable?
              %p Restaurants choose to be available only during times they know they'll have seating.  Less waiting for you, and a more beneficial opportunity for them.  So, depending on what time you visit our app, you might see an unclaimed restaurant as unavailable.  Feel free to email/facebook/tweet us on when a certain restaurant will be "open" next.
            %li
              %h3 Can I make a reservation for later?
              %p Not at this time.  When you download a ticket, it'll only be available for a short time and a short time after.  Another reason to move quickly. :-)
            %li
              %h3 What if I want to donate my compensated check to someone who needs it?
              %p We would be happy to donate your compensated check, in the form of a huge restaurant gift card, to the family of your choice.  You could really rock someone's world.
            %li
              %h3 Why are you guys doing this?
              %p We think there exists "space" where restaurants can benefit, and consumers can benefit at the same time without harming each other.  Economics majors might call what exists today "a Pareto inefficiency".  Anywayâ¦ if restaurants fill tables when they're vacant, and those obliging to fill tables get special treatment, all through FoodCircles, our company might stand to benefit.  At the core of each of us though, we know that if we benefit, we have the responsibility to help others not as fortunate.  So that's why we buy a meal for someone in need every time someone fills a table through our app.  When you eat, so do they.

              %p
                Keep all receipts/proofs of purchase! You will not be eligible to receive a reimbursement check without it!  The number of compensated meals available is equal to the number of FoodCircles Restaurant partners.  One (1) compensated meal is available per restaurant.  To receive a reimbursement check, entrant must be the first to dine at the restaurant using a valid voucher from FoodCircles after the start of The Great Race, and before the end of The Great Race.  Before June 05, 2012, entrant must submit a photo, or scanned copy, of the receipt onto either a personal Facebook.com page or a personal Twitter.com page.  The entrant must "tag" and/or "mention" FoodCircles in the posting of the image.  A successful "tag" on Facebook will require the account to have "Liked" the FoodCircles Facebook page.  FoodCircles LLC reserves the right to demand further proof, resubmission, or original copy in order to verify accuracy of the receipt.  If verified to be accurate AND if the first receipt "posted" on
                Facebook or Twitter from a previously unclaimed FoodCircles restaurant, FoodCircles LLC will contact, via electronic media, the entrant requesting the entrant's mailing address.  A list of claimed and unclaimed FoodCircles Restaurants will be made available on the FoodCircles website.  FoodCircles LLC will write & dispatch one (1) reimbursement check for the amount listed on the receipt, or the listed limit on our website, whichever is lower.  FoodCircles LLC is not responsible for an inaccuracy in the given address, failed delivery/receipt, lost mail, etc. If the potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) days after the date of the first attempt to contact him/her, the FoodCircles LLC may cancel payment or select an alternate winner at their sole discretion.
