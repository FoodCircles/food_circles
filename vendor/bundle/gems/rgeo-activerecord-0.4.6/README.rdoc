== RGeo::ActiveRecord

RGeo::ActiveRecord is an optional {RGeo}[http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo]
module providing spatial extensions for \ActiveRecord, as well as a set
of helpers for writing spatial \ActiveRecord adapters based on \RGeo.

=== Summary

\RGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the
Ruby programming language. At its core is an implementation of the
industry standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data
representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons,
along with a set of geometric analysis operations. See the README for the
"rgeo" gem for more information.

RGeo::ActiveRecord is an optional \RGeo add-on module providing spatial
extensions for \ActiveRecord, as well as a set of helpers for writing
spatial \ActiveRecord adapters based on \RGeo.

=== Installation

RGeo::ActiveRecord has the following requirements:

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later. Ruby 1.9.2 or later preferred.
* rgeo 0.3.20 or later.
* activerecord 3.0.3 or later. Earlier versions will not work.
  Should be compatible with Rails versions through 3.2.x.
* arel 2.0.6 or later. Earlier versions will not work.

Generally, \ActiveRecord adapters which depend on this module should be
installed as gems, and they will install this module automatically as
a dependency. However, you can also install it manually as a gem:

  gem install rgeo
  gem install rgeo-activerecord

See the README for the "rgeo" gem, a required dependency, for further
installation information.

=== To-do list

We consider this gem to be in a late alpha state. There are a still a
few holes in the intended functionality, but it is now being tested in a
variety of contexts, and we know of several successful production
deployments.

We are also currently working on a mechanism for constructing complex
spatial queries via extensions to Arel. This work is in the experimental
stage.
