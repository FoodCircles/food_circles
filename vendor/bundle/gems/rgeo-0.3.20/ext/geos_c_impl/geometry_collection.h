  Comopares the contents of two geometry collections. Does not test the
  types of the collections themselves, but tests the types, values, and
  contents of all the contents. The two given geometries MUST be
  collection types-- i.e. GeometryCollection, MultiPoint, MultiLineString,
  or MultiPolygon.
  Returns Qtrue if the contents of the two geometry collections are equal,
  Qfalse if they are inequal, or Qnil if an error occurs.
