    module SRSDatabase


      # A spatial reference database implementation backed by coordinate
      # system files installed as part of the proj4 library. For a given
      # Proj4Data object, you specify a single file (e.g. the epsg data
      # file), and you can retrieve records by ID number.

      class Proj4Data


        # Connect to one of the proj4 data files. You should provide the
        # file name, optionally the installation directory if it is not
        # in a typical location, and several additional options.
        #
        # These options are recognized:
        #
        # [<tt>:dir</tt>]
        #   The path for the share/proj directory that contains the
        #   requested data file. By default, the Proj4Data class will
        #   try a number of directories for you, including
        #   /usr/local/share/proj, /opt/local/share/proj, /usr/share/proj,
        #   and a few other variants. However, if you have proj4 installed
        #   elsewhere, you can provide an explicit directory using this
        #   option. You may also pass nil as the value, in which case all
        #   the normal lookup paths will be disabled, and you will have to
        #   provide the full path as the file name.
        # [<tt>:cache</tt>]
        #   If set to true, this class caches previously looked up entries
        #   so subsequent lookups do not have to reread the file. If set
        #   to <tt>:read_all</tt>, then ALL values in the file are read in
        #   and cached the first time a lookup is done. If set to
        #   <tt>:preload</tt>, then ALL values in the file are read in
        #   immediately when the database is created. Default is false,
        #   indicating that the file will be reread on every lookup.
        # [<tt>:authority</tt>]
        #   If set, its value is taken as the authority name for all
        #   entries. The authority code will be set to the identifier. If
        #   not set, then the authority fields of entries will be blank.
