    # == SFS 1.1 Description
    #
    # A Point is a 0-dimensional geometric object and represents a single
    # location in coordinate space. A Point has an x-coordinate value and
    # a y-coordinate value.
    #
    # The boundary of a Point is the empty set.
    #
    # == Notes
    #
    # Point is defined as a module and is provided primarily
    # for the sake of documentation. Implementations need not necessarily
    # include this module itself. Therefore, you should not depend on the
    # kind_of? method to check type. Instead, use the provided check_type
    # class method (or === operator) defined in the Type module.
    #
    # Some implementations may support higher dimensional points.
    #
    # Some libraries, such as GEOS, support "empty" points. Such objects
    # might be returned as, for example, the centroid of an empty
    # MultiPolygon. The SFS does not clearly define or even acknowledge
    # the existence of such a type, so RGeo will currently generally
    # replace them with empty GeometryCollection objects. Therefore,
    # currently, every RGeo Point object represents an actual location
    # with real coordinates.
