== Unique Slugs by Scope

The {FriendlyId::Scoped} module allows FriendlyId to generate unique slugs
within a scope.

This allows, for example, two restaurants in different cities to have the slug
+joes-diner+:

    class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend FriendlyId
      belongs_to :city
      friendly_id :name, :use => :scoped, :scope => :city
    end

    class City < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend FriendlyId
      has_many :restaurants
      friendly_id :name, :use => :slugged
    end

    City.find("seattle").restaurants.find("joes-diner")
    City.find("chicago").restaurants.find("joes-diner")

Without :scoped in this case, one of the restaurants would have the slug
+joes-diner+ and the other would have +joes-diner--2+.

The value for the +:scope+ option can be the name of a +belongs_to+ relation, or
a column.

=== Finding Records by Friendly ID

If you are using scopes your friendly ids may not be unique, so a simple find
like

    Restaurant.find("joes-diner")

may return the wrong record. In these cases it's best to query through the
relation:

    @city.restaurants.find("joes-diner")

Alternatively, you could pass the scope value as a query parameter:

    Restaurant.find("joes-diner").where(:city_id => @city.id)


=== Finding All Records That Match a Scoped ID

Query the slug column directly:

    Restaurant.find_all_by_slug("joes-diner")

=== Routes for Scoped Models

Recall that FriendlyId is a database-centric library, and does not set up any
routes for scoped models. You must do this yourself in your application. Here's
an example of one way to set this up:

    # in routes.rb
    resources :cities do
      resources :restaurants
    end

    # in views
    <%= link_to 'Show', [@city, @restaurant] %>

    # in controllers
    @city = City.find(params[:city_id])
    @restaurant = @city.restaurants.find(params[:id])

    # URLs:
    http://example.org/cities/seattle/restaurants/joes-diner
    http://example.org/cities/chicago/restaurants/joes-diner
