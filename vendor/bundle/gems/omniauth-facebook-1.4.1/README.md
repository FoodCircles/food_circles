# OmniAuth Facebook &nbsp;[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook)

Facebook OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

Supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side and client-side flows. Read the Facebook docs for more details: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-facebook'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Facebook` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']
end
```

[See the example Sinatra app for full examples](https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/example/config.ru) of both the server and client-side flows (including using the Facebook Javascript SDK).

## Configuring

You can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the Facebook docs for a full list of available permissions: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/permissions. Default: `email`
* `display`: The display context to show the authentication page. Options are: `page`, `popup` and `touch`. Read the Facebook docs for more details: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/. Default: `page`
* `auth_type`: Optionally specifies the requested authentication features as a comma-separated list, as per https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/reauthentication/.
Valid values are `https` (checks for the presence of the secure cookie and asks for re-authentication if it is not present), and `reauthenticate` (asks the user to re-authenticate unconditionally). Default is `nil`.
* `secure_image_url`: Set to `true` to use https for the avatar image url returned in the auth hash. Default is `false`.
* `image_size`: Set the size for the returned image url in the auth hash. Valid options are `square` (50x50), `small` (50 pixels wide, variable height), `normal` (100 pixels wide, variable height), or `large` (about 200 pixels wide, variable height). Default is `square` (50x50).

For example, to request `email`, `user_birthday` and `read_stream` permissions and display the authentication page in a popup window:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET'],
           :scope => 'email,user_birthday,read_stream', :display => 'popup'
end
```

### Per-Request Options

If you want to set the `display` format or `scope` on a per-request basis, you can just pass it to the OmniAuth request phase URL, for example: `/auth/facebook?display=popup` or `/auth/facebook?scope=email`.

You can also pass through a `state` param which will be passed along to the callback url.

### Custom Callback URL/Path

You can set a custom `callback_url` or `callback_path` option to override the default value. See [OmniAuth::Strategy#callback_url](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/blob/master/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L411) for more details on the default.

## Auth Hash

Here's an example *Auth Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'facebook',
  :uid => '1234567',
  :info => {
    :nickname => 'jbloggs',
    :email => 'joe@bloggs.com',
    :name => 'Joe Bloggs',
    :first_name => 'Joe',
    :last_name => 'Bloggs',
    :image => 'http://graph.facebook.com/1234567/picture?type=square',
    :urls => { :Facebook => 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs' },
    :location => 'Palo Alto, California',
    :verified => true
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'ABCDEF...', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you may wish to store
    :expires_at => 1321747205, # when the access token expires (it always will)
    :expires => true # this will always be true
  },
  :extra => {
    :raw_info => {
      :id => '1234567',
      :name => 'Joe Bloggs',
      :first_name => 'Joe',
      :last_name => 'Bloggs',
      :link => 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs',
      :username => 'jbloggs',
      :location => { :id => '123456789', :name => 'Palo Alto, California' },
      :gender => 'male',
      :email => 'joe@bloggs.com',
      :timezone => -8,
      :locale => 'en_US',
      :verified => true,
      :updated_time => '2011-11-11T06:21:03+0000'
    }
  }
}
```

The precise information available may depend on the permissions which you request.

## Client-side Flow

You can use the Facebook Javascript SDK with `FB.login`, and just hit the callback endpoint (`/auth/facebook/callback` by default) once the user has authenticated in the success callback.

Note that you must enable cookies in the `FB.init` config for this process to work.

See the example Sinatra app under `example/` and read the [Facebook docs on Client-Side Authentication](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/client-side/) for more details.

### How it Works

The client-side flow is supported by parsing the authorization code from the signed request which Facebook places in a cookie.

When you call `/auth/facebook/callback` in the success callback of `FB.login` that will pass the cookie back to the server. omniauth-facebook will see this cookie and:

1. parse it,
2. extract the authorization code contained in it
3. and hit Facebook and obtain an access token which will get placed in the `request.env['omniauth.auth']['credentials']` hash.

Note that this access token will be the same token obtained and available in the client through the hash [as detailed in the Facebook docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/client-side/).

## Canvas Apps

Canvas apps will send a signed request with the initial POST, therefore you *can* (if it makes sense for your app) pass this to the authorize endpoint (`/auth/facebook` by default) in the querystring.

There are then 2 scenarios for what happens next:

1. A user has already granted access to your app, this will contain an access token. In this case, omniauth-facebook will skip asking the user for authentication and immediately redirect to the callback endpoint (`/auth/facebook/callback` by default) with the access token present in the `request.env['omniauth.auth']['credentials']` hash.

2. A user has not granted access to your app, and the signed request *will not* contain an access token. In this case omniauth-facebook will simply follow the standard auth flow.

Take a look at [the example Sinatra app for one option of how you can integrate with a canvas page](https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/example/config.ru).

Bear in mind you have several options (including [authenticated referrals](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/authentication/#referrals)). Read [the Facebook docs on canvas page  authentication](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/canvas/) for more info.

## Token Expiry

Since Facebook deprecated the `offline_access` permission, this has become more complex. The expiration time of the access token you obtain will depend on which flow you are using. See below for more details.

### Client-Side Flow

If you use the client-side flow, Facebook will give you back a short lived access token (~ 2 hours).

You can exchange this short lived access token for a longer lived version. Read the [Facebook docs about the offline_access  deprecation](https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/) for more information.

### Server-Side Flow

If you use the server-side flow, Facebook will give you back a longer loved access token (~ 60 days).

If you're having issue getting a long lived token with the server-side flow, make sure to enable the 'deprecate offline_access setting' in you Facebook app config. Read the [Facebook docs about the offline_access  deprecation](https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/) for more information.

## Supported Rubies

Actively tested with the following Ruby versions:

- MRI 1.9.3
- MRI 1.9.2
- MRI 1.8.7
- JRuby 1.6.5

*NB.* For JRuby, you'll need to install the `jruby-openssl` gem. There's no way to automatically specify this in a Rubygem gemspec, so you need to manually add it your project's own Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jruby-openssl', :platform => :jruby
```
